Oxygen Framework Builder Plugin
===============================

This plugin allows the developer to define the user interface to Author View, by using only XQuery, HTML, and a bit of CSS. So, no need to for Java!

It generates a framework that is ready to be used.

This project is using icons from http://famfamfam.com/.
